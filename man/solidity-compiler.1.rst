Synopsis
========

solidity-compiler *[options]* *contract_file*

Description
===========

Easy to use, easy to write bash Solidity Compiler
using Hardhat and solc under the hood.

It depends on the Crash Bash library and uses
GNU Indent to properly parse Hardhat configuration
files at runtime to create run-once projects.

It is a dependency for EVM Make and so a build
dependency for projects written using the LibEVM
library.

This project is part of the EVM Toolchain.
